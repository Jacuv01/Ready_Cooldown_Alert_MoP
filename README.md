Ready Cooldown Alert is a lightweight and efficient World of Warcraft addon that provides customizable visual notifications when your spells, abilities, and items are ready to use. When you use a spell or ability, the addon tracks its cooldown and displays an animated icon on your screen when it becomes available again, ensuring you never miss important abilities during combat. You can customize the animation style, position, size, and filter which spells to track.

**Inspired by [Doom_CooldownPulse](https://github.com/aduth/Doom_CooldownPulse)**, Ready Cooldown Alert was built from the ground up to include all the features I always wanted: advanced filtering system, dynamic spell suggestions, modular architecture, and enhanced customization options that go beyond the original concept.

## Features

- **Smart Cooldown Detection**: Automatically tracks spells, abilities, and items.
- **Animations**: Multiple animations including pulse, glow, bounce, and more
- **Advanced Filtering System**: Include or exclude specific spells with name-based or ID-based filtering
- **Performance Optimized**: Minimal CPU usage with efficient cooldown tracking algorithms
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive configuration panel
- **Position Settings**: Adjust X/Y coordinates and icon size
- **Threshold Settings**: Set when notifications should appear based on remaining cooldown time
- **Add Spells/Items**: Use the search system to add spells by name or ID
- **Invert Mode**: Switch between include/exclude filtering modes

## Acknowledgments

This addon was inspired by [Doom_CooldownPulse](https://github.com/aduth/Doom_CooldownPulse) by aduth. While keeping the main idea of showing cooldown alerts, Ready Cooldown Alert was built from scratch with new features that I always wanted in a cooldown addon.
